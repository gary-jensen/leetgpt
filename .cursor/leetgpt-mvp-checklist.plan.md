# LeetGPT MVP Checklist

## Implementation Plan & Order

### Phase 1: Foundation & Core Infrastructure (Week 1-2)

#### 1. Async execution and execution timeout ⚠️ HIGH PRIORITY

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED** - Timeout implemented using sandboxed iframe execution
**Dependencies**: None
**Effort**: Medium
**Details**:

-   ✅ Added 10-second timeout to `algoTestExecutor.ts` (configurable via `timeoutMs` parameter)
-   ✅ Timeout implemented in `CodeExecutor` using `setTimeout` - resolves promise after timeout
-   ✅ Cancellation message sent to iframe when timeout occurs
-   ✅ Algorithm test execution script checks for cancellation between test cases
-   ✅ Proper cleanup of timeouts and error handling for timeout scenarios
-   ✅ Works with sandboxed iframe execution (no freezing, async execution)
-   ✅ Timeout prevents infinite loops from blocking the UI

**Files modified**:

-   ✅ `src/lib/execution/algoTestExecutor.ts` - Added cancellation handling and timeout checks
-   ✅ `src/lib/execution/codeExecutor.ts` - Enhanced timeout mechanism with cancellation messages
-   ✅ `src/features/algorithms/hooks/useAlgoProblemExecution.ts` - Passes timeout to executor

**Note**: Timeout is enforced at the CodeExecutor level, which sends cancellation messages to the sandboxed iframe. The algorithm test execution script checks for cancellation between test cases and stops execution when cancelled. This prevents infinite loops from freezing the page while maintaining full feature parity with type converters, judges, etc.

#### 2. Submission history (like leetcode) 📊

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED** - Full submission history UI implemented with tabbed interface
**Dependencies**: None (can work in parallel with #1)
**Effort**: Medium-High
**Details**:

-   ✅ Created tabbed UI in ProblemStatementChat panel (Description, Submissions tabs)
-   ✅ Submissions tab displays: status (Accepted/Wrong Answer), language, runtime, date
-   ✅ Submission detail tab shows: code in read-only editor, test cases passed, runtime, metadata
-   ✅ Clicking a submission opens detail view in new "Submission" tab with close button
-   ✅ Submissions list updates automatically when code is run (no refresh needed)
-   ✅ Copy to clipboard and copy to editor functionality in submission detail view
-   ✅ Server action `getSubmissionHistory` fetches last 50 submissions per problem

**Files modified/created**:

## Summary Order

### Complete

-   **Async execution and execution timeout** - Foundation, affects all execution
-   **Submission history** - Core feature, can work in parallel with #1
-   **Sound effects** - Quick UX win, low effort
-   **Analytics** - Important for understanding usage, medium effort
-   **Feedback button** - Quick feature, good for user input
-   **Daily limits** - Must be done before Stripe to define premium value

### Todo

-   **Finalize algorithm lesson system** - Complete core system before UX enhancements
-   **AI Chat suggestions** - UX enhancement, medium effort
-   **Stripe/payment** - Final monetization step, depends on #8

## Notes

-   Algorithm lesson system (#10) should be finalized early as it's foundational
-   Items 4-7 can be done in parallel as they're independent
-   Analytics (#8) benefits from having submission history (#2) in place
-   Daily limits (#9) should define what premium gets you before building Stripe (#10)
-   Consider MVP scope: Some items might be simplified for initial launch
